### Gameplay and mechanics
#### Gameplay 
The gameplay starts of with the player in the middle of space, the player then has to roam around and find enemy AI that will be around the map area. Once you are in range of the enemy AI they will then start attacking the players ship. Once the player finds all the enemies ships and destroys them, the level is completed and then the next one will start.
#### Objectives
The objectives of the game is to destroy all enemy AI wihin the zone to then progress to the next level. Each level will become harder and there will then be bosses which will make the objective more challenging.
#### Mechanics
The mechanics of the game are simple to understand. Firstly there is a timer which increases until all the enemy AI are eliminated, this is then calculated how long the player takes to finish the level. Depending on the amount of time the player took, it will give the player less points to the overall score. Then there is the health system for the player ship, this has a score of 100. Every time the ship gets hit by a laser from the enemy AI it will lose 5 health, but if the player crashes into the enemy ship or an astroid floating around the player ship is completely destroyed. Next, is the amount of kills that the player has from destroying the enemy AI, this is shown so that the player then knows how many enemy AI are left within the level. And to the last points mechanic there is the points for the every kill a player does, each enemy AI entity has a random range of points between 50-100. This is all added together with the timer at the end of the level. Now there is the mechanics of the player, the ship is able to move forwards, backwards and then turn left and right so that the ship can aim at the enemies. The ship is also able to shoot laser blast rapidly depending on the players speed of button pressing. The enemy Ai also have similar mechanics to the players ship but it waits for when the ship is detected and in range of the players ship. Once in range the enemy will engage and start shooting but not as rapid as the player will. There are also astroids within the map that are stationary but if the enemy or the player crashes into them, it will destroy the ship.
