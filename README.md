## Space Conqueror 

### Game overview
#### Game concept
The game concept is a simple space fighter which the player is able to use to roam around space to destroy enemy AI ships within the sector. Once the sector is cleared of all enemy AI, the player is then able to progress to the next one. This also gets progressively harder after each sector.
#### Genre/Theme
The genre of this game is an Action Sci-Fi which also has arcade type gameplay. The arcade type gameplay allows the player to play multiple times if their ship has been destroyed and they know that they dont have to start all over again to work their way up. The theme is set in space which 
#### Target audience
The target audience is focused for ages 11 and above, since the game includes action and the difficulty for younger would not be fun for them.

### Gameplay and mechanics
#### Gameplay 
The gameplay starts of with the player in the middle of space, the player then has to roam around and find enemy AI that will be around the map area. Once you are in range of the enemy AI they will then start attacking the players ship. Once the player finds all the enemies ships and destroys them, the level is completed and then the next one will start.
#### Objectives
The objectives of the game is to destroy all enemy AI wihin the zone to then progress to the next level. Each level will become harder and there will then be bosses which will make the objective more challenging.
#### Mechanics
The mechanics of the game are simple to understand. Firstly there is a timer which increases until all the enemy AI are eliminated, this is then calculated how long the player takes to finish the level. Depending on the amount of time the player took, it will give the player less points to the overall score. Then there is the health system for the player ship, this has a score of 100. Every time the ship gets hit by a laser from the enemy AI it will lose 5 health, but if the player crashes into the enemy ship or an astroid floating around the player ship is completely destroyed. Next, is the amount of kills that the player has from destroying the enemy AI, this is shown so that the player then knows how many enemy AI are left within the level. And to the last points mechanic there is the points for the every kill a player does, each enemy AI entity has a random range of points between 50-100. This is all added together with the timer at the end of the level. Now there is the mechanics of the player, the ship is able to move forwards, backwards and then turn left and right so that the ship can aim at the enemies. The ship is also able to shoot laser blast rapidly depending on the players speed of button pressing. The enemy Ai also have similar mechanics to the players ship but it waits for when the ship is detected and in range of the players ship. Once in range the enemy will engage and start shooting but not as rapid as the player will. There are also astroids within the map that are stationary but if the enemy or the player crashes into them, it will destroy the ship. 
#### Physics
There is not a huge amount of physics within the game. The first one is the laser blasts that come out from the enemy AI and the players ship. Once a ship has taken a shot the laser blast will keep flying until it is out of the cameras range of the player. The stationary asteroids have a spinning physic on them which shows the player that it is not part of the background but an entity which the player can crash into. And finally the player ship has a gravity affect which stops the ships from floating around in space, so if the player does not press a button to move it will stay stationary.
#### Movement 
The movement in the game is simple, the player is able to move forwards, backwards and then the ship is able to turn clockwise and anti-clockwise. The speed of the ship when moving forwards and backwards is at a moderate speed so that the ship does not fly past all the enemies. The movement of the AI also is similar to what the player has but of course if in view range the AI will start engaging the players ship.  
#### Combat
The combat system for the Ai and the player is simply, the player shoots his laser which does 10 damage for every hit. The AI only do 5 damage but both Ai and player have 100 health. The reason why the AI do less damage is because there are more AI than the player. 

### Interface
#### Visual system
The visual system for both the AI and player are very basic, since this is a top down view 2D game. The camera for the player is rectangular and the player is able to see an AI before both starting firing. The AIs visual system is that once the AI is in camera view of the player then they will start firing at the player. 
#### Control system
The controls for the player is the arrows keys on the keyboard, which is up and down for forwards and backwards, the left and right arrows keys are used for turning the ship clockwise and anti-clockwise. And finally the shooting of the lasers is the spacebar.
