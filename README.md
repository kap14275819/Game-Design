A game design document is the blueprint from which a game is to be built.  As such, every single detail necessary to build the game should be addressed.  The larger the team and the longer the design and development cycle, the more critical is the need.  For your purpose, the intent is to capture as much as possible of your design.  I want you to think big在igger than what you are able to develop.  I also want you to be clear about what the software delivers and what the design entails.  My recommendation is that you define the ultimate game and then clarify what it is that you have developed.  If you are finding it too difficult to do that, you may produce too documents.
